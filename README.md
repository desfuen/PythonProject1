This is the first project I shared on here which is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Python. 
With the help of AI I added a bit of flair with ASCII art and a jumping effect as I've only studied the 
basics of Python these past few weeks. 

Features:
- User vs Computer gameplay with random computer choices.
- ASCII art for rock, paper, scissors scenarios.
- Jumping text effect to highlight results.
- Input validation to ensure only valid choices.
- Line by line and side by side display of player and computer moves.

How it works: 
- The user is prompted to type either Rock, Paper. or Scissors.
- The computer randonly selects its move.
- The game displays both choices side by side.
- The result is shown with a jumping effect.
- If the input is invalid, the user is asked to try again.
